**[Example Project](https://file-metadata-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/)**  

**HINT:** You can use the `multer` npm package to handle file uploading.

- [x] You should provide your own project, not the example URL.
- [x] You can submit a form that includes a file upload.
- [x] The form file input field has the `name` attribute set to `upfile`.
- [x] When you submit a file, you receive the file `name`, `type`, and `size` in bytes within the JSON response.

#### Customization & Cleanup
- [x] Optimize code and remove testing console logs, deprecate file but keep copy for reference later
- [x] Document operations of code
