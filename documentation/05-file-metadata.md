### Timestamp Microservice Conditions

**[Instructions For Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/file-metadata-microservice)**  
**[Example Project](https://file-metadata-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/)**  

**HINT:** You can use the `multer` npm package to handle file uploading.

- [ ] You should provide your own project, not the example URL.
- [ ] You can submit a form that includes a file upload.
- [ ] The form file input field has the `name` attribute set to `upfile`.
- [ ] When you submit a file, you receive the file `name`, `type`, and `size` in bytes within the JSON response.

#### Customization & Cleanup
- [ ] Optimize code and remove testing console logs, deprecate file but keep copy for reference later
- [ ] Document operations of code
